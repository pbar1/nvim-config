# Neovim Config :waxing_crescent_moon:

My personal Neovim configuration.

**Note:** Vim plugins are managed via [Nix][1] (as flake inputs). To use [Packer][2],
there is an [autogenerated file](lua/config/packer.lua) that bootstraps it and
installs plugins. This is only here for convenience - _you must load this file
yourself!_

### Docker

You can try out this configuration by running it in a container. This command
mounts your current directory as the container working directory and launches
Neovim.

```sh
docker run                 \
  --rm --interactive --tty \
  --env="TERM=$TERM"       \
  --volume="$PWD:/workdir" \
  --workdir="/workdir"     \
  ghcr.io/pbar1/nvim-config:latest
```

## Notes & TODOs

- (debug): Make debug UI not exit on completion. Would also be nice to have a
  Telescope keybind to expand views (local vars, etc)
- (lang): Helm and Terraform syntax highlighting could use some work
- (general): If launched in a directory, reopen the last session
- (general): `z`-like directory changing
- (editor): Twilight.nvim colors are broken
- (completion): nvim-cmp first run sometimes shows `Workspace loading` -
  investigate if this is due to large repos
- (lang): C# LSP, completion, and (maybe) DAP
- (lang) Go plugin like rust-tools
